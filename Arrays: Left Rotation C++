/*
A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. 
For example, if  left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become .
Given an array of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

n is length of the array
k is number of rotation to the left
